# Cryptographic Optimizations: ChaCha20, Poly1305, and ECDH

This project focuses on optimizing three widely used cryptographic primitives ‚Äî **ChaCha20**, **Poly1305**, and **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** ‚Äî for efficient execution on the **ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller**.  

The motivation behind this work is to improve performance while maintaining correctness and security properties such as constant-time execution. Cryptographic primitives are often performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained environments (e.g., embedded systems, IoT), making such optimizations highly relevant.

## üìå Project Goals

- Start from public C reference implementations of:
  - [ChaCha20](https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#chacha)  
  - [Poly1305](https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#poly1305)  
  - ECDH key exchange on Curve25519 in Edwards form
- Re-engineer the implementations to run **substantially faster** on the ARM Cortex-M4.
- Ensure that the optimized code:
  - Has **no secret-dependent branches** or memory accesses (constant-time execution).  
  - Passes all regression tests (functional correctness preserved).  
  - Substantially outperforms the reference implementations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementations & Optimizations

### üîπ ChaCha20
- Optimized **rotate function** using single assembly instruction.  
- Removed **function calls** to eliminate push/pop overhead.  
- **Loop unrolling** reduced cycles further.  
- **Result:** 27,491 cycles (‚âà15% reduction).

### üîπ Poly1305
- Changed internal representation from **radix-8 ‚Üí radix-26**.  
- Designed an efficient **8-bit to 26-bit shifter translation** for constant-time performance.  
- Optimized **modular multiplication** for the new radix.  
- **Result:** 27,091 cycles (‚âà69% reduction).

### üîπ ECDH
- Eliminated secret-dependent branching to avoid timing leaks.  
- Implemented **fixed-window scalar multiplication** (œâ = 4) with precomputation table.  
- Optimized field arithmetic using **radix-26** representation.  
- Handled intermediate multiplication overflow with modular reduction.  
- **Result:** 15.6M cycles (‚âà66% reduction).
