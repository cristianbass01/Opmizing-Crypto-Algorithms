# Cryptographic Optimizations: ChaCha20, Poly1305, and ECDH

This project explores performance optimizations of three widely used cryptographic algorithms: **ChaCha20**, **Poly1305**, and **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**.  
Our goal was to reduce execution cycles while ensuring correctness and constant-time execution to prevent side-channel attacks.

## üìå Project Overview

We implemented and optimized:
- **ChaCha20** (stream cipher)  
- **Poly1305** (message authentication code)  
- **ECDH** on Ed25519 curves (key exchange protocol)

The optimizations were focused on:
- **Assembly-level improvements**  
- **Radix transformation (from 8 to 26)**  
- **Constant-time implementations to mitigate timing leaks**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementations & Optimizations

### üîπ ChaCha20
- Optimized **rotate function** using single assembly instruction.  
- Removed **function calls** to eliminate push/pop overhead.  
- **Loop unrolling** reduced cycles further.  
- **Result:** 27,491 cycles (‚âà15% reduction).

### üîπ Poly1305
- Changed internal representation from **radix-8 ‚Üí radix-26**.  
- Designed an efficient **8-bit to 26-bit shifter translation** for constant-time performance.  
- Optimized **modular multiplication** for the new radix.  
- **Result:** 27,091 cycles (‚âà69% reduction).

### üîπ ECDH
- Eliminated secret-dependent branching to avoid timing leaks.  
- Implemented **fixed-window scalar multiplication** (œâ = 4) with precomputation table.  
- Optimized field arithmetic using **radix-26** representation.  
- Handled intermediate multiplication overflow with modular reduction.  
- **Result:** 15.6M cycles (‚âà66% reduction).
